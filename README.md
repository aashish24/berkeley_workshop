Welcome to the GitHub repository for the first URSSI workshop. The venue for the meeting is the **Chevron room** at the Berkeley International House [2299 Piedmont Ave Berkeley, CA 94720](https://goo.gl/maps/Mz4Fr4kKyc22). The workshop will begin at 8:30 am on Tuesday with more details available in the agenda below.

### Meeting location

The venue is at the intersection of Piedmont and Bancroft and an easy walk from downtown (or a short ride share from anywhere in Berkeley). There are numerous options for lunch spots right on Bancroft and Telegraph, with even more options downtown. Thursday's meeting rooms will be the Sproul and Golub (Home) Room upstairs.
